# Playgrounds SHK

Code repository for SHKs @ VSP

## Organization

Each student is supposed to put his code in a sub-directory at the top-level. We strongly advise to use the matsim-example-project as the initial project structure. 

The example project is already included as submodule. To use it check it out first:

- git submodule init
- git submodule update

and then simply copy its content to a new folder. Please name your folder as your vsp username.
